# Final Project ‚Äì Automated Jira Ticket Pipeline

## üìñ Project Description
This project implements an AI-driven pipeline that transforms project requirements (from `.docx` documents) into structured Jira tickets.  
The system leverages multiple LLM-powered agents to:
- Parse and review the document structure.
- Predict labels, priorities, and assignee groups.
- Optionally generate SQL subtasks (DDL + SELECT queries).
- Visualize the Jira ticket hierarchy in a tree view.

The final outcome is a set of Jira issues automatically created through the Jira REST API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions


### .env File

A .env file should be created in the same folder that the Final_Project.ipynb exists, with the following parameters.

Jira connection (required)
- JIRA_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com          # Your Jira account email
- JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token             # API token from Atlassian account
- JIRA_BASE_URL=https://yourcompany.atlassian.net  # Jira base URL
- JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=ABC                      # Target Jira project key

OPEN AI API Key (required)
- OPENAI_API_KEY                            # Your OPEN AI API Key

Custom fields (optional)
- JIRA_FIELD_ASSIGNED_GROUP=customfield_10124  # Jira custom field for "Assigned Group". It is a custom field in Jira that should be created for all tickets (Epic, Task, Subtask) named "Assigned Group". By clicking on inspect, you can find customfield_... of the field and add it to the .env file
- JIRA_EPIC_NAME_FIELD=customfield_10011       # Custom field for Epic Name (if required in your Jira)
- JIRA_EPIC_LINK_FIELD=customfield_10014       # Custom field for Epic Link (if required in your Jira)

Epic / Task handling options
- TEAM_MANAGED_EPIC_PARENT=false    # Set to true if using Team-managed project where Epics behave differently


### Input Files

Document (.docx):
Provide your requirements document in Word format. Example: requirements.docx.

Database Schema (.txt):
Provide the database schema in plain text. Example: schema.txt.
This is only required if you want to generate SQL subtasks (include_sql=True).


### Jira Setup

Before running the pipeline, make sure:
- You have Create Issues permission in the Jira project.
- You have created an API Token in your Atlassian account.
- The custom fields referenced in .env exist in your Jira project.
- In Jira, if you want to have the assignee group (optional) field the following groups should be created:

        - Business Analysis Team
        - Business Intelligence Team
        - Configuration Engineer Team
        - Data Warehouse Team
        - Project Management Office (PMO)
        - Quality Assurance Team

If you don't want to create these teams and you want other, you should also change the parameter "groups_list" in the Final_Project.ipynb in order to include them there also.


### Running the pipeline

Near the end of the Final_Project.ipynb, there are two parameters, "doc_path" that should contain your docx path and "schema_text" that should contain you database schema (txt file).

The final Pipeline contains four parameter:
- doc_path
- schema_text (None if you do not want the option)
- include_sql (True or False)
- include_assignee_group (True or False)
