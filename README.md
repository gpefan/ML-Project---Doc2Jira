# Final Project – Automated Jira Ticket Pipeline

## 📖 Project Description
This project implements an AI-driven pipeline that transforms project requirements (from `.docx` documents) into structured Jira tickets.  
The system leverages multiple LLM-powered agents to:
- Parse and review the document structure.
- Predict labels, priorities, and assignee groups.
- Optionally generate SQL subtasks (DDL + SELECT queries).
- Visualize the Jira ticket hierarchy in a tree view.

The final outcome is a set of Jira issues automatically created through the Jira REST API.
